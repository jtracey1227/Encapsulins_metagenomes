# HMMER searches: 

#(Protein searches) 

hmmsearch -o <name of output file> —-acc --tblout <file name for tabular output> <path to hmm profile> <path to metagenome that is to be searched> 

#(DNA searches) 

nhmmer -o <name of output file> <path to hmmprofile> <path to metagenome>

#Assembly using IDBA_UD

idba_ud -l <path to post quality control DNA reads> -o <name of output file> --num_threads 10

#-l specifies that the reads in the input file are longer than 100bp. This is the “long read” option. 

#Note - The above script will not run to completion because IDBA cannot create a scaffold without paired-end reads. The contig-100.fa file was used for ORF prediction.  

#ORF Prediction using Prodigal

prodigal -i <path to input file> -a  <desired name of output file in faa format> -p meta -g 11 -d <output file containing nucleotide sequences of the translated proteins> -o < output file containing gene coordinates> -f gff
 
#-a = a file containing the predicted genes’ protein sequences
#-p meta = selects which mode of prodigal to run. Because we are predicting genes in metagenomic sequences we want metagenomic mode. 
#-g 11 = which translation table to use. 11 is the standard bacterial and archaeal table. 
#-d = a file containing the nucleotide sequences of the translated proteins
#-o = an output file specifying the gene coordinates
#-f = specifies that the output format is gff. 

#Command Line BLASTp 

blastp -query <path to query fasta file> -db nr -num_threads 20 -max_target_seqs 10 -outfmt 11 -out <output file name>

#-db specifies which protein database to search “nr” = non-redundant and is the standard   database.
#—max target seqs instructs the program how many sequences to display, 10 means that the 10 best hits will be displayed. 
#—outfmt species the output format. 11 is an archival format that can be converted into many other formats

#qseqid    =  Gives query sequence ID
#qlen      =  Gives the length of the query sequence
#sseqid    =  Gives the subject sequence id
#slen      =  Gives length of the subject sequence (the hit) 
#qstart    =  Returns start of the region of the query that has a hit
#qend      =  Returns end of the region of the query that has a hit
#sstart    =  Returns start of the subject sequence that has a hit
#send      =  Returns end of the subject sequence that has a hit
#length    =  Gives alignment length
#pident    =  Returns percentage of identical matches
#nident    =  Returns number of identical matches
#mismatch  =  Returns number of mismatches
#e value   =  Reports an e-value for each hit
#bit score =  Reports a bit score for each hit
#sgi       =  Gives subject GI 
#saccver   =  Subject accession number
#stitle    =  Gives subject title
